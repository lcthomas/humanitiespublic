    "## Compare Two Variables using Chi-Square Test\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you to compare two variables to see if they are related. It implements a chi-square test for independence to determine if distributions of categorical variables differ from one another in a statistically meaningful sense. In our article, we use a chi-square test to determine if there is a relationship between the subject an article is about (science or the humanities) and the type of newspaper that article appears in (top-circulating newspapers or student newspapers).\n",
