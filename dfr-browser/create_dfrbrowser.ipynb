    "This notebook provides an interface to code that creates Andrew Goldstone's [dfr-browser](https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser) from a topic model produced with MALLET. Dfr-browser code, stored in this module in `dfrb_scripts`, was written by Andrew Goldstone and adapted for our use and data. We use an older version of Goldstone's code (v0.5.1); see https://agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser/ for a version history of Goldstone's code. WE1S uses Goldstone's prepare_data.py Python script to prepare the data files (https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser/blob/master/bin/prepare-data), NOT the R package.\n",
